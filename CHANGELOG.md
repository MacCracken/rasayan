### Added

- **enzyme** — Michaelis-Menten kinetics, competitive/uncompetitive inhibition, Hill equation (allosteric cooperativity), Q10 temperature dependence, EnzymeParams with catalytic efficiency
- **metabolism** — MetabolicState tracking ATP/ADP balance, energy charge, aerobic/anaerobic yield, metabolic rate, glucose consumption and ATP regeneration
- **signal** — Signal transduction: dose-response (Hill function), receptor occupancy, SecondMessenger state (cAMP, Ca2+, IP3), Gs/Gq pathway activation, messenger decay
- **protein** — 20 standard amino acids with Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity, molecular weight, side-chain pKa. Sequence molecular weight calculation, composition analysis
- **membrane** — Nernst potential, Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation, Fick's first law diffusion, IonicState with typical mammalian neuron concentrations
- **energy** — BioenergyState: phosphocreatine/glycogen reserves, MET-based exertion, O2 consumption, anaerobic threshold, energy depletion/recovery dynamics
- **error** — `RasayanError` with variants for negative concentration, invalid parameter, unknown amino acid, unknown pathway
- **logging** — Optional structured logging via `RASAYAN_LOG` env var (feature-gated)
- Initial criterion benchmarks for enzyme kinetics, membrane potential, and signal transduction
